# Ramzabrowser

A browser project like Chrominum but better privacy, incognito, face id, and more!

We use TypeScript, and its for vscode.dev and the VS Code Desktop!

Go to the search bar then add: ``/chatRamini (your message)`` to chat Ramini!
Developer tools are advanced! 

Also go to the Devtools > Console > press ``CTRL + R`` to chat anytime.
